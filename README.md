# UC Davis AI for Health Website

This repository contains the static website for the UC Davis AI for Health initiative. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to highlight the program's mission, research focus areas, people, events, and opportunities for engagement.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI-for-Health-Website
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to view the site locally. No build step or server is required, though using a lightweight static server (such as `python -m http.server`) can help when developing locally.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main landing page containing the full site content and styles.
- `img/` – Directory reserved for site imagery. Add your graphics, logos, or photography to this folder and reference them from `index.html` or future pages.

## Adding Images

Place any images in the `img/` directory. The folder currently contains a placeholder `.gitkeep` file so that it remains in version control; feel free to remove the placeholder once real assets are added.

## Contributing

When updating the site:

- Keep the design consistent with UC Davis branding (blue and gold palette).
- Test the layout at multiple viewport sizes to preserve responsive behavior.
- Ensure that any new assets placed in `img/` are optimized for the web.

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with improvements, bug fixes, or content updates.
